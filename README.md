# gocondo
Site to encourage personal contact and enhance security in a Condo
The rough outline:
1. Need a login page I cans start with a single password, then I won't need server side interaction.  Need to learn server side programming so I can make this more secure.
I have to decide if I want to make this private at some point.
2. Want to encourage people to post a head shot, name and Apt. # so people will be encouraged to greet each other by name and really get to know each other and therefore who is allowed to actually be in the condo
3. Want a graphical navigation page to make it easy and enjoyable to browse Condo Members headshots
4. Want to tie in a listserve or create a blog page for people to participate and site issues they have or things are seeing
5. Eventually, I want to tie in the camera feeds so we can monitor the building's public spaces.  More live eyes mean more security.
